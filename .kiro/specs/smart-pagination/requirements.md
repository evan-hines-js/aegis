# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Smart Pagination System is designed to intelligently prioritize and paginate MCP server tools based on deep client interaction history. This system addresses the critical challenge where LLMs struggle with tool selection when presented with too many options (dozens of MCP servers with ~7 tools each = 70+ tools). By tracking every client interaction, tool call, and usage pattern, the system will dynamically surface the most relevant tools for each client, improving LLM performance and user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an MCP hub administrator, I want to track comprehensive client interaction data, so that I can understand how clients use different tools and servers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client makes any MCP request THEN the system SHALL record the interaction with timestamp, client ID, server ID, tool name, and request context
2. WHEN a client calls a specific tool THEN the system SHALL increment usage counters for that tool, server, and client combination
3. WHEN a client session begins THEN the system SHALL create a session tracking record with unique session ID
4. WHEN a client interaction occurs THEN the system SHALL capture contextual metadata including request parameters, response success/failure, and execution time
5. IF an interaction fails THEN the system SHALL record the failure reason and error type for analysis

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an MCP client, I want to receive the most relevant tools first in paginated responses, so that the LLM can make better tool selection decisions with fewer options.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client requests tools THEN the system SHALL return tools ranked by relevance score based on historical usage patterns
2. WHEN pagination is requested THEN the system SHALL prioritize tools with higher client-specific usage frequency
3. WHEN no historical data exists for a client THEN the system SHALL fall back to global usage patterns and tool popularity
4. WHEN tools have similar usage patterns THEN the system SHALL consider recency of use as a tiebreaker
5. IF a client has used fewer than 10 tools historically THEN the system SHALL blend personal and global rankings

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system analyst, I want to analyze tool usage patterns across clients, so that I can identify optimization opportunities and popular tool combinations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing usage data THEN the system SHALL provide aggregated statistics by tool, server, client, and time period
2. WHEN identifying patterns THEN the system SHALL detect frequently used tool combinations and sequences
3. WHEN generating insights THEN the system SHALL calculate tool adoption rates and usage trends over time
4. WHEN a tool shows declining usage THEN the system SHALL flag it for potential deprecation analysis
5. IF usage patterns change significantly THEN the system SHALL trigger alerts for system administrators

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an enterprise administrator, I want manual control over pagination strategies, so that I can optimize tool visibility based on organizational needs and usage patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing usage analytics THEN the system SHALL provide insights to manually adjust tool ranking weights and priorities
2. WHEN new tools are deployed THEN administrators SHALL be able to configure initial visibility and promotion settings
3. WHEN usage patterns are analyzed THEN the system SHALL suggest ranking adjustments that administrators can approve or reject
4. WHEN tool performance metrics indicate issues THEN the system SHALL provide recommendations for pagination strategy changes
5. IF organizational priorities change THEN administrators SHALL be able to manually override automatic rankings for specific tools or servers
